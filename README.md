# Differential Drive Robot

## Introduction

This project is designed to control a mobile differential drive robot.

The robot includes the following devices and sensors:

- Single board computer **Raspberry pi 4 8gb**
- Hardware platform **Arduino Mega 2560**
- Motor driver **TB6612FNG**
- Hall-Effect Magnetic Encoder **AS5600 x2**
- I2C Multiplexer **CJMCU-9548 (for encoders)**

## Robot design

Below is the connection of all elements

## Dependencies

This code works on Arduino Mega 2560 using **PlatformioIO**

You can download [PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html#piocore-install-shell-commands) separately.

Or use the [Visual Studio Code IDE Extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode).

(Please note that you do not need to install PlatformIO Core if you are going to use PlatformIO IDE. PlatformIO Core is built into PlatformIO IDE and you will be able to use it within PlatformIO IDE Terminal.)
